# Tribal Vapes Production

## Technology Used
With this project being to build a static website only a few technologies will/have been used in the planning and production of the website. Starting with planning stage, there was only one piece of technology used which was a software called 'Balsamiq Wireframes' and this was used to create the wireframe plans for the three web pages within the website.

Moving to the production stage, there was two main technologies as well as an additional sub-technology which has been for a few different elements throughout the website. Beginning with the main ones which are GitHub and GitPod, GitPod is a cloud based IDE that has been where all of code for both the HTML and CSS components have been created, GitHub is the cloud based software that has been used as the version control for the project but also where the project has been saved to.
