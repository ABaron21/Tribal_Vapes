# Tribal Vapes Production

## Technology Used
Balsamiq Wireframes - Used to build/create the basic visual template for the website across all screen sizes.

GitPod - Cloud based IDE used to create and build the code for the website with HTML & CSS.

HTML - Programming language used to build the structure of the website/web pages by the use of elements and different components.

CSS - The styling for the website, used to make the web pages more visually appealing.

Bootstrap - An external libary used that aims to focus on the resposiveness of the website.

GitHub - A cloud based storage used as the version control for the production by committing and pushing at various stages throughout the development.

GitPages - Used to deploy the final development.

### Bugs
One bug that occured during the production was whilst the implementation of the collapsable navigation bar was being added and the error shown below kept showing in the chrome dev tool.

After looking over code, the reason for this bug to appear was the simple solution that versions for bootstrap that had been added were all different so resolving the situation was just a case of making sure all the bootstrap scripts/links were all the same version.

### Screens
All web pages within the website have been tested to make sure that they are responsive for all screen sizes starting at mobile devices and increasing upwards to tablets, laptops and finally desktops being the typically largest screen expected for a browser window.

----
## Deployment
As this project is only a small website production consisting of three web pages with just HTML and CSS, the website will be deployed through GitHub's GitPages as there's hardly any functionality behind the website so GitPages will be able to deploy the website and it'll be stable to view each web page with navigating between them and seeing the content of each page.
