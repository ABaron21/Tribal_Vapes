# Tribal Vapes

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a static website based around just HTML and CSS, which displays both how a website is structured using different html elements as well as how a page is styled with css componants.

## User Stories
As a customer I would like to see reviews/feedback from other customers so I can see how other people have liked the service and products sold.

As a customer I would like to read about the company so I can find out about the company with how they express their business and how they help expand their user friendly expierience.

As a customer I need to be able to see a wide range of products that the company sells so I can decide a choice from multi different brands/flavours and different rechargables.

## Features
With the project only being a static website there are only a few features such navigating between 3 different pages as well as a collapsable nav menu for smaller screen sizes like mobile devices. On the home/index page there is a jumbotron feature that displays a promotion for first time users, below that is a section that shows three recommended items with a review section under the recommended that displays two reviews about the website/company.

On the about page there'll be three sections, the first being a small text section describing what Tribal Vapes is about, the second section will talk about the ceo of the company, at the bottom of page will be a section that'll show the leaders of three main departments that'll consist within the business.

The third page on the website is a shopping page that'll consist of four sections that'll be similar but the only difference will be the type of items being displayed, the main feature of the page is a dropdown selection that'll have different flavours or colours.

## Future Features
Future plans for features to be added to the website is a shopping basket system, account system with a wallet/payment system, a contact section where customers can leave feedback or ask any questions. A change that could be made is a more depth shopping page that would extend into sub-pages based on the type of product.

## Typography & Color Scheme
The font that will be used throughout the web pages is "Ubuntu"(Link to font) with different font weights for a regular, bold and light font style. The font colour is going to be an offset white.

The background colour scheme that will be set for the pages on the website is going to be an outer wrapper for the page that will be a light blend of grey and dark blue with an inner wrapper that is going to be a light charcoal colour.

An additional element is with images used within the website will have a thin solid black border around the image which will add a bit of extra style to the images.
