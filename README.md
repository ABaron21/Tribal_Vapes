### Bugs
One bug that occured during the production was whilst the implementation of the collapsable navigation bar was being added and the error shown below kept showing in the chrome dev tool.

![fixed-bug](docx/snippet.PNG)

After looking over code, the reason for this bug to appear was the simple solution that versions for bootstrap that had been added were all different so resolving the situation was just a case of making sure all the bootstrap scripts/links were all the same version.

### Screens
All web pages within the website have been tested to make sure that they are responsive for all screen sizes starting at mobile devices and increasing upwards to tablets, laptops and finally desktops being the typically largest screen expected for a browser window.

----
## Deployment
Two versions on deployment:
* GitPod - used throughout the development by typing 'python3 -m http.server' in the terminal which gives a prompt to open in a new tab within the browser.
* GitPages - the final deployment of the website which makes it accesible to the public.
